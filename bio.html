        <h1 class="bio">Olá!</h1>
        <p class="eu">
            Born in 86 in the second largest capital of Latin America, São Paulo,
            I moved to Bahia at the age of 7, where I encountered one of my great passions, the sea.</br>
            As an adult, I moved to Florianópolis to pursue another great love: anthropology.
            I spent some of the best years of my life there.</br> A few years later, I moved to Germany,
            where, for almost 10 years now, “makes the familiar strange and the strange familiar” has become a daily task.</br></br>
            Books, cuisine, music, dance and relationships of solidarity make my life even more interesting.
